There are two main problems I want to solve.
Making sure my network is secure. Devices should not have free-for-all access to everything on the home network. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with IPs (as much as possible) for the services running at home. IPs often become a chore and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to think about them - I want to treat my services as cattles, not pets.</description></item><item><title>Homelab Introduction</title><link>https://harrigan.xyz/posts/homelab/2023-07-21-introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harrigan.xyz/posts/homelab/2023-07-21-introduction/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through many iterations of my homelab over the years. It usually involves completely rewriting everything - but that&amp;rsquo;s just a part of the learning process.
I started from manually setting up a server, adding automation with Ansible, containerizing applications with Docker and docker-compose, to running a Kubernetes cluster on my Dell R620 I snagged off of /r/homelabsales.
My latest setup has been pretty awesome, but it&amp;rsquo;s time for an upgrade.</description></item></channel></rss>
